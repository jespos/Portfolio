      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Volkswagen enthusiasts have a variety of ways to access information: from online forums
        and Facebook groups for asking questions and posting photos, to personal cloud storage for
        storing car-related documents. But, no cohesive app currently exists where Volkswagen
        enthusiasts can store and share their passion from one platform.</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>V-DUBS is free storage and sharing app for Volkswagen enthusiasts to share photos, tell stories,
        upload documents related to your passion, and ask questions to the community.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>I conducted 2 user surveys. The first survey on cloud storage elicited interesting
      results that warranted conducting a second survey on social media usage.</p>

    <!--User Survey 1: Cloud Storage -->
    <h3>User Survey 1: Cloud Storage</h3>

    <!-- In Depth Interviews -->
    <p>In-depth interviews:</p>
    <h3>Cars and Coffee</h3>
    <p>I had coffee with several members of the Volkswagen community to learn more about
      their web habits as they pertain to Volkswagen. I learned there are 3 major tasks that
      Volkswagen enthusiasts do:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Share and view photos of Volkswagens</li>
        <li>Ask questions to the community</li>
        <li>Upload / share car-related paperwork and documents</li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Lesson -->
    <h3>Lesson: collecting more data isn't bad.</h3>
    <p>The addition of a second user survey set me back on my  timeline. But, I felt that
      gathering additional data (especially after analyzing the results of the first survey)
      in order to create an app that the community wants to use was well worth the extra week
      and a half.</p>

    <!-- Competitive Analysis -->
    <p>Competitive Analysis</p>
    <h3>Sizing up the competition.</h3>
    <p>I performed competitive and SWOT analyses on 2 cloud storage platforms (Google Drive and Dropbox)
      and 1 social/organizational platform, Pinterest. I learned that opportunities do exist to create a
      pleasant, easy to use platform that has easy to find and store information tailored to a specific
      user base.</p>

    <!-- User Personas -->
    <p>User Personas</p>
    <h3>Many people. Common Motivations.</h3>
    <p>When I attend Volkswagen events, I observe several types of people. Using my own observations, along
      with survey datal previously discussed, I generated 3 personas:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enthusiasts</li>
      <li>Creatives (i.e. photographers)</li>
      <li>Learners (i.e. car restoration)</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- Persona 1 -->
    <img src="images/persona_learner.png" alt="Marco. The Learner">
    <h3>Marco</h3>
    <h4>The Learner | 27 years old</h4>
    <h5>Motivations:</h5>
    <p>I love cars and am currently restoring a 1996 Volkswagen Jetta. I want to easily share restoration
      photos and ask questions to the community.</p>
    <h5>Frustrations:</h5>
    <p>I find myself sharing content in multiple places. I don’t want to use multiple apps to find and
      share information.</p>

    <!-- Persona 2 -->
    <img src="images/persona_enthusiast.png" alt="Brett. The Enthusiast.">
    <h3>Brett</h3>
    <h4>The Enthusiast | 65 years old</h4>
    <h5>Motivations:</h5>
    <p>I consider myself an amateur car restorer, collector, and photographer. I want an app where I can share
      my passion with others who feel the same.</p>
    <h5>Frustrations:</h5>
    <p>I can’t find any cohesive apps related to this community. The other platforms I use are cluttered with
      irrelevant information. </p>

    <!-- Persona 3 -->
    <img src="images/persona_creative.png" alt="Ellie. The Creative.">
    <h3>Ellie</h3>
    <h4>The Creative | 34 years old</h4>
    <h5>Motivations:</h5>
    <p>I manage automobile exhibits for an antique auto museum and enjoy driving my classic VW to auto shows. I want
      an easy way to create notes and share photos in one app. </p>
    <h5>Frustrations:</h5>
    <p>Uploading my notes to share with others isn’t easy and I can’t create new content with my current apps.</p>

    <!-- User Stories -->
    <p>User Stories</p>
    <h3>Less is more.</h3>
    <p>After researching apps and creating a lengthy list of tasks a user wants to do on the app, I prioritized
      tasks to create an MVP.</p>
    <p>High Priority Items</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sign up for new account</li>
      <li>Sign into account</li>
      <li>Create content</li>
      <li>View content</li>
      <li>Upload content</li>
      <li>Comment on content</li>
      <li>Share content</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Lesson -->
    <h3>Lesson: ‘Important’ functionality ≠ ‘high’ priority</h3>
    <p>The mistake I originally made was including too many high priority user stories. I decided to re-evaluate
      each user story using the 80/20 rule. Because a priority isn’t set to high, does not mean I won’t develop it.
      It will just be developed with less urgency.</p>

    <img src="images/vdubs_moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard inspiration for app">
    <p>Volkswagen is a playful brand with vibrant vehicle colors and humorous, vintage car ads it
      was important for V-DUBS to incorporate these values into the brand. I want the target audience
      to identify with the elements of the app: from the logo design and color palette to typography and imagery.</p>
    <!-- Logo -->
    <p>Logo</p>
    <h3>From word cloud to V-DUBS</h3>
    <img src="images/logo_sketches.png" alt="Word cloud and logo sketches">
    <img src="images/logo_vdubs_lg.png" alt="Final V-DUBS logo">
    <p>The logo evolved from a word cloud of car-related terms to the final version of a Volkswagen Beetle.
      The logo needed to be clear and easily identifiable. There is almost nothing else more identifiable than
      the shape of a Volkswagen Beetle.</p>
    <p>The name, V-DUBS, is a play on letters V-W. I played with other names, but quickly settled on this as
      it is an identifiable term in the VW community. The font itself resembles the font found on European license plates.</p>

    <!-- Color Palette -->
    <p>Color Palette</p>
    <h3>Color me vintage.</h3>
    <p>Primary Colors</p>
    <img src="images/color_navy.png" alt="Navy color">

    <p>#F9B81C</p>
    <img src="images/color_white.png" alt="White color">
    <p>#FDF8F0</p>
    <p>The palette is composed of classic Volkswagen car colors from the 1960s and 1970s. Primary colors are found mostly
      on the landing page. In the app, the colors remain neutral with subtle pops of color. The focus in-app is on the content
      being shared.</p>

    <p>Typography</p>
    <h3>What's your type?</h3>

    <p>FE Font is a display font that mimics the font used on European license plates it is used only for the logo. Lato is a simple,
      modern font to complement the playfulness of Fe Font and is used for all headlines and text throughout the app.</p>

    <!-- Lesson -->
    <h3>Lesson: You wont catch everything the first go around</h3>
    <p>When moving from user testing round 1 to my hi-fi mockups, I noticed several tasks that
      I should have tested for. They were incorporated into the second round of user testing.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In the Volkswagen community, everyone has a story. V-DUBS is a platform for every VW lover and enthusiast to
      share their story. Being a Volkswagen enthusiast myself, this project was fun to bring from concept to completion.
      Though I expected my initial timeline to be shorter, encountering and dealing with these problems in the beginning
      (i.e. a second user survey to collect more data) made for 1) less assumptions about what users want and 2) an accurate
      app representing the wants and needs of the community. One of my major challenges was containing / limiting scope creep.
      I have so many interesting ideas for what the app could be in the future. So, I had to resist the urge to do all the things at once with the app.</p>
